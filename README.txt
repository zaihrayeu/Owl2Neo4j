1. Build the project using Maven
2. Run the OntologyLoader class providing the path to an owl file as an argument to the main method. It will import the owl ontology to neo4j
3. Run the OntologyReader class to print teh current ontologies in neo4j
4. Enjoy :-))

NOTE: the project is in an initial experimental phase and does not provide complete import of OWL ontologies to Neo4j
